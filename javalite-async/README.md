# JavaLite Async is an asynchronous processor for Java applications

It is a wrapper library for processing asynchronous jobs. It can be used in a web application to process
 jobs in a thread separate from the one that renders HTML. It is also a general purpose library that can be used in any
 non-web system.

Internal Implementation is based on [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/).
